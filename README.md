### Running

You'll need to have `node` and `npm` installed, then run

```
npm install
```

after you've cloned and `cd`'d into this repo.

Next, create a folder called `test-images` in this directory, which you'll have to put some images in. You can change what image you run on in `index.js`. Finally, just `node index.js` to run.
